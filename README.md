# t-nary_Trees
c++ algorithm generating t-nary Trees with n-1 internal nodes

Inputs: t - number of children of one parent node, n - number of internal nodes

Output: every possible t-nary tree with n-1 nodes as 0 or 1 sequence, where 1 means that this node has a child and 0 means that this node has no children
